implement classes



classes will work mainly with overloading. they 'overload' whatever functions they want, including ones taht don't exist. the objects can have properties accessable with the .prop syntax.

ooorrrr classes won't work like that at all, and just be containers of data, and then you can still overload functions with particular type signatures. so you can still overload things like '+' with the particular type signature that you want.

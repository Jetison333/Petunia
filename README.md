# Petunia
Petunia is an esoteric ish programming language. it uses prefix notation for everything, meaning you don't need paranthesis for precedence. Even control flow follows prefix notation, for example if statements expect three operands; something that evaluates to true or false, and then two expresions. the if statement only evaluates one of the expressions and passes on that value.
